1) Specifying unaliased `_governor` address may result in a loss of control over bridge contracts
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L114-L119
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1WethBridge.sol#L120

While deploying bridges we specify the `_governor` address which will be a proxy admin and owner of the beacon contract. If `_governor` is a contract on L1 we need to provide an aliased address for the initialization function, failure to do so will result in loss of control over newly deployed bridges and beacon, because L2 contracts will compare the aliased msg.sender to the `owner()` or proxyAdmin() value in the storage. 

Mailbox will alias any `msg.sender` if it was sent by the contract

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L248-L250

In the current zkSync deployment `governor` is a multisig wallet with the address `0x4e4943346848c4867F81dFb37c4cA9C5715A7828` that resides on L1. It's aliased address on L2 is the `0x5f5a43346848C4867F81DFB37C4ca9c5715A8939`. We can check that by querying the Beacon `owner()`.

It will be much safer if we add a check similar to this 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L312-L314

```
        if (_governor.code.length > 0) {
            _governor = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(_governor);
        }
```

to avoid specifying unaliased `_governor` address

2) Redundant check

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/system-contracts/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L273

we already make this check in the `getCodeHash` above

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/system-contracts/contracts/AccountCodeStorage.sol#L102

3) typo

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/system-contracts/contracts/L1Messenger.sol#L206

should be `require(numberOfL2ToL1Logs <= L2_TO_L1_LOGS_MERKLE_TREE_LEAVES, "Too many L2->L1 logs")`, thus we fail more gracefully if there are too many logs
