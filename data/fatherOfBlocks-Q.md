- L205 - abi.encodePacked() should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as keccak256()
Use abi.encode() instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will prevent hash collisions (e.g. abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456) => 0x123456 => abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456), but abi.encode(0x123,0x456) => 0x0...1230...456). “Unless there is a compelling reason, abi.encode should be preferred”. If there is only one argument to abi.encodePacked() it can often be cast to bytes() or bytes32() instead.
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, bytes.concat() should be used instead.

- L58/69/98 - According to the Solidity style guide, functions should be laid out in the following order :constructor(), receive(), fallback(), external, public, internal, private, but the cases below do not follow this pattern

**ethereum/contracts/zksync/ValidatorTimelock.sol**
- L33/46 - There is a variable in storage zkSyncContract, which is immutable and in the constructor it is not validated which value is defined, therefore it is important that a validation is added that the input is != 0x.

- L181 - A division is made by an input, _gasPricePerPubdata, which could be == 0, therefore it is important to previously validate that input to throw the corresponding error.
