# Q/A Report for [ZKSync] by K42

## Possible Q/A Optimizations for [Getters.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol)

Possible Q/A Optimization 1: Use Constants for Magic Numbers
- Description: The contract uses magic numbers like error codes in require statements. These can be stored as constants. This will improve readability and maintainability.

Here is the optimized code snippet:




```solidity
// Before
require(ds.selectorToFacet[_selector].facetAddress != address(0), "g2");

// After
bytes32 constant ERROR_CODE = "g2";
require(ds.selectorToFacet[_selector].facetAddress != address(0), ERROR_CODE);
```


Possible Optimization 2 =  
- The contract uses multiple ``uint256`` state variables like ``totalBatchesCommitted`` on lines [42](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L42) and [215](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L215), and ``totalBatchesVerified`` on lines [47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L47) and [221](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L221), etc. These can be packed into a single ``uint256`` if their sizes are smaller than 256 bits.
- Extra Context: Similarly this is related to ``"Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots"`` and ``"State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots"`` from the bot report list. However, this optimization is specifically focusing on packing multiple ``uint256`` variables into a single ``uint256`` and therefore is unique.

Here is the optimized code snippet:




```solidity
// Before
uint256 totalBatchesCommitted;
uint256 totalBatchesVerified;

// After
uint256 packedData;  // 128 bits for totalBatchesCommitted, 128 bits for totalBatchesVerified
```




## Possible Q/A Optimizations for [TransactionValidator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/TransactionValidator.sol) 

Possible Optimization 1: Minimize the Scope of Variables
- Description: Declare variables as close as possible to their usage to minimize their scope and thereby reduce stack depth. To improve readability and maintainability.


Possible Optimization 2: Reduce the Scope of Temporary Variables
- Description: Declare temporary variables like ``costForComputation`` and ``costForPubdata`` within the smallest possible scope to free up stack space. To improve readability and stack management.

Code Snippet:




```solidity
{
    uint256 costForComputation = ...;
    // ...
}
```





Possible Optimization 3: Use unchecked Blocks for Arithmetic Operations
- In the function ``getTransactionBodyGasLimit``, you're already using ``unchecked`` for the subtraction. You can also use ``unchecked`` blocks for other arithmetic operations where overflows or underflows are not possible due to prior checks.




```solidity
// Before
uint256 costForComputation = L1_TX_INTRINSIC_L2_GAS;
costForComputation += Math.ceilDiv(_encodingLength * L1_TX_DELTA_544_ENCODING_BYTES, 544);

// After
unchecked {
    uint256 costForComputation = L1_TX_INTRINSIC_L2_GAS;
    costForComputation += Math.ceilDiv(_encodingLength * L1_TX_DELTA_544_ENCODING_BYTES, 544);
}
```




Possible Optimization 4: Use Lookup Tables for Fixed Calculations
- Description: There are calculations that yield fixed results, I suggest to use a lookup table.


## Possible Q/A Optimizations in [Diamond.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol)

Possible Optimization 1: Use Constants for Repeated Magic Numbers or Strings
- Description: The contract uses magic numbers and strings like ``0xc8fcad8db84d3cc18b4c41d551ea0ee66dd599cde068d998e57d5e09332c131b``. These can be stored as constants. This is safe and improves the maintainability of the contract.

Optimized Code Snippet:




```solidity
// Before
bytes32 constant DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION = 0xc8fcad8db84d3cc18b4c41d551ea0ee66dd599cde068d998e57d5e09332c131b;

// After
bytes32 constant DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("diamond.standard.diamond.storage");
```
