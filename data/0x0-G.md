# Governance execute functions could save gas using checks effects interaction pattern

## Finding

In both execute(Operation calldata _operation) and executeInstant(Operation calldata _operation), we have a common repetitive logic over the operation state and the execution:
```
// Ensure that the operation is ready to proceed.
require(isOperationReady(id), "Operation must be ready before execution");
// Execute operation.
_execute(_operation.calls);
// Reconfirming that the operation is still ready after execution.
// This is needed to avoid unexpected reentrancy attacks of re-executing the same operation.
require(isOperationReady(id), "Operation must be ready after execution");
// Set operation to be done
timestamps[id] = EXECUTED_PROPOSAL_TIMESTAMP;
```

In that case, it would be more efficient to move the timestamps[id] assignation line **before executing the calls**. This way it won't be possible to re-enter the given proposal, avoiding an extra check.

## Suggestion

```
// Ensure that the operation is ready to proceed.
require(isOperationReady(id), "Operation must be ready before execution");
// Set operation to be done
timestamps[id] = EXECUTED_PROPOSAL_TIMESTAMP;
// Execute operation.
_execute(_operation.calls);
```

This way no operation can be executed through reentrancy as call would fail on the operation state require statement (set to DONE), removing extra computations and checks.
