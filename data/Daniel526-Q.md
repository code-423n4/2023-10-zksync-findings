## A. Overdependency on Timestamp
[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/72f5f16ed4ba94c7689fe38fcb0b7d27d2a3f135/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol#L74-L95)
The contract uses timestamps for various checks, such as ensuring that batches are processed in chronological order and verifying the validity of timestamps in L2 blocks. Timestamps are fundamental to these checks, but they can be manipulated in certain situations. For instance, miners can potentially influence timestamps to some extent, leading to inaccuracies in batch processing or verification.

Here is an example of timestamp dependency in the `_verifyBatchTimestamp` function:
```solidity
function _verifyBatchTimestamp(
    uint256 _packedBatchAndL2BlockTimestamp,
    uint256 _expectedBatchTimestamp,
    uint256 _previousBatchTimestamp
) internal view {
    // Check that the timestamp that came from the system context is expected
    uint256 batchTimestamp = _packedBatchAndL2BlockTimestamp >> 128;
    require(batchTimestamp == _expectedBatchTimestamp, "tb");

    // While the fact that _previousBatchTimestamp < batchTimestamp is already checked on L2,
    // we double check it here for clarity
    require(_previousBatchTimestamp < batchTimestamp, "h3");

    // ...
}

```
### Impact:
Timestamp manipulation or inaccuracies can lead to incorrect batch processing and verification. If timestamps are not properly validated or if in any case they get manipulated by miners, it could potentially allow out-of-order or maliciously crafted batches to disrupt the contract's intended operation.
### Mitigation:
While using `block.number` as a mitigation strategy is a good approach to reduce timestamp-related vulnerabilities, it's important to strike a balance between using timestamps and block numbers based on the specific requirements of the contract. In some cases, a combination of both may be appropriate for comprehensive validation.
