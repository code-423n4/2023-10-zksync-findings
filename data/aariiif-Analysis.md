# zkSync Codebase Analysis Report

zkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages ZK-rollups. This analysis focuses on the core components, including the bridge contracts for asset transfers between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) and the infrastructure for processing L2 transactions.

## Architecture

zkSync employs a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture, consisting of key contracts:

| Contract           | Functionality                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| L1 Bridge          | Finalizes deposits and withdrawals on L1 after L2 confirmation |
| L2 Bridge          | Manages deposits and withdrawals on L2                  |
| L2 Processor       | Processes L2 transactions and publishes data to L1      |

## Centralization Risks

### Trusted Operator

The L2 Processor currently relies on a trusted operator to provide data, including L1 gas prices. This introduces some centralization. To mitigate this risk:

- **Recommendation:** Transition towards a decentralized sequencer model to reduce reliance on a single operator.

### Upgrades

The upgrade process for core contracts, such as the L2 Bridge, is centralized through the Beacon proxy pattern, potentially enabling malicious upgrades. To enhance transparency and security:

- **Recommendation:** Implement a DAO or on-chain gauge voting for upgrade decisions.
- **Recommendation:** Consider moving critical contracts, like the L2 Bridge, to a transparent admin-less implementation once stability is ensured.

## User Funds Safety

### Deposits

User funds are locked on L1 and minted as L2 tokens during deposits, ensuring:

- Only the L1 Bridge can finalize deposits.
- L2 tokens are minted only after deposit finalization.
- The L1 Bridge cannot mint more L2 tokens than initially locked on L1.

### Withdrawals

Similar protections exist for withdrawals. Additionally, user L2 account state is committed on-chain with each transaction through storage roots, allowing users to challenge invalid state transitions and withdraw funds, safeguarding against data availability issues.

**Recommendation:** Consider formal verification of the token bridging logic to provide additional assurance over deposit/withdrawal processes.

## Economic Incentives

The L2 fee model charges fees based on:

- Gas usage.
- Data availability costs.
- One-time fees per transaction.

This model offers flexibility while mitigating issues like DOS attacks. No apparent incentives were identified that users could exploit for profit.

## EVM Compatibility

zkSync aims for high EVM compatibility with minimal code changes required. EVM-specific risks are mitigated through:

- Verified computation of EVM execution.
- System call flags to constrain access.
- Utilization of the SystemCaller library for interacting with contracts.

These measures help prevent unexpected side effects.

## Conc

zkSync features a well-designed architecture and incentives model tailored for ZK rollups. As the system matures, taking steps to decentralize trust assumptions and upgrade control will reduce systemic centralization risks, making zkSync more resilient for the long term.
