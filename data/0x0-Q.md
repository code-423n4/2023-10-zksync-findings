# Consider adding min value to Governance updateDelay to avoid same block execution

# Finding
In Governance contract updateDelay function, nothing prevents that delay to be set to 0.
If somehow this value ends up being set to 0, this would allow instant transparent upgrades, which could even be executed within the same block, increasing the attack surface in such cases.

# Mitigation
Consider adding a **minimum** value **greater than zero** to reduce the impact of such a situation.

```
function updateDelay(uint256 _newDelay) external onlySelf {
    // Here for demo purposes only ensuring > 0, could be any other reasonable non-null value
    require(_newDelay > 0, "Delay must be greater 0);
    emit ChangeMinDelay(minDelay, _newDelay);
    minDelay = _newDelay;
}
```
