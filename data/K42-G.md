## Gas Optimization Report for [ZkSync](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync) by K42

- This Gas Optimization Report is split into 4 sections for efficiency: 
- [Section 1: ZkSync](#section-1-zksync): **Total Gas Saved Estimate = Approximately 35,428 - 40,853 gas**
- [Section 2: Bridges](#section-2-bridges): **Total Gas Saved Estimate = Approximately 60,030 - 90,060 gas**
- [Section 3: Governance](#section-3-governance): **Total Gas Saved Estimate = Approximately 6,000 - 13,000 gas **
- [Section 4: Upgrades](#section-4-upgrades): **Total Gas Saved Estimate = Approximately 5,200 - 10,400 gas**
- **Overall Gas Saved Estimate = Approximately 106,658 - 154,313 gas**

- I have also added ``Extra Context:`` Markers on specific optimizations that are somewhat similar to the bot report optimizations, to clarify the uniqueness for better efficiency. 

### **Section 1: ZkSync**:

### Possible Optimizations in [Executor.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Instead of using separate state variables for multiple boolean flags, you can use a single ``uint256`` and manipulate its bits to represent multiple flags. This will reduce the storage cost. This is completely safe as long as you manage the bits carefully and avoid overflows. 
- Extra context: The bot report mentions ``using uint256(1)/uint256(2) instead of true/false to save gas``, which is a similar concept to this one but not identical, therefore this is a unique gas optimization and is not present on the bot report.

After Optimization:




```solidity
uint256 public flags;

function setFlag(uint256 _flag, bool _value) internal {
    if (_value) {
        flags |= _flag;
    } else {
        flags &= ~_flag;
    }
}

function getFlag(uint256 _flag) internal view returns (bool) {
    return (flags & _flag) != 0;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 15,000 - 20,000 gas per ``flag`` operation.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [_checkBit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol#L472C2-L475C1) and [_setBit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol#L477C3-L479C6) functions can be optimized by using bitwise operations directly in the function that calls them, instead of calling these functions separately. This will save the gas used for function calls.
- Extra context: Unique in relation to the bot report.

After Optimization:




```solidity
// Instead of calling _checkBit(processedLogs, uint8(logKey)), use:
bool isBitSet = (processedLogs & (1 << uint8(logKey))) > 0;

// Instead of calling _setBit(processedLogs, uint8(logKey)), use:
processedLogs |= (1 << uint8(logKey));
```




- Estimated gas saved = 200-400 gas per function call (depends on the EVM version and gas schedule). 

### Possible Optimization in [Mailbox.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- The contract uses ``public view`` functions like [proveL2LogInclusion()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L64C1-L71C6). If these functions are only reading data and not modifying state, they can be invoked using ``staticcall`` in assembly, which is gas-efficient for read-only operations.



```solidity
// Before
return _proveL2LogInclusion(_batchNumber, _index, _log, _proof);

// After
bool result;
assembly {
    result := staticcall(gas(), address(this), add(_data, 0x20), mload(_data), _out, 0x20)
}
require(result, "Static call failed");
```




- Estimated Gas Savings = Approximately 100-200 gas per operation.

### Possible Optimizations in [Diamond.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- In both [_saveFacetIfNew()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol#L190C1-L199C6) and the [_addOneFunction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol#L206C1-L229C6) functions, they are using ``push`` for array operations. These operations include bounds checking, which can be avoided using unchecked blocks if you are certain about the array's state.
- Extra Context: The bot report list mentions using ``unchecked {}`` in specific contexts like divisions and subtractions but doesn't explicitly mention array operations, therefore this is unique. 

After Optimizations:




```solidity
// In _saveFacetIfNew: Before
ds.facets.push(_facet);

// After
unchecked {
    ds.facets.push(_facet);
}


// In _addOneFunction: Before
ds.facetToSelectors[_facet].selectors.push(_selector);

// After
unchecked {
    ds.facetToSelectors[_facet].selectors.push(_selector);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 10-20 gas per operation. Due to the ``PUSH``, ``POP``, ``SSTORE`` opcodes being used less frequently, therefore saving gas.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Enums are internally represented as integers. Using bitwise operations can sometimes be more gas-efficient than using ``enums``.

After Optimization: 




```solidity
// Before
if (action == Action.Add) { ... }

// After
if (action & 1 == 1) { ... }  // Assuming Action.Add is represented by 1
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 5-10 gas per operation. This uses bitwise ``AND`` and equality ``EQ`` opcodes which are generally cheaper than loading from storage ``SLOAD``.

### Possible Optimization in [Getters.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- The [isDiamondStorageFrozen()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L129C2-L132C6) function returns a ``bool``. Bitwise operations can be more gas-efficient.
- Extra Context: This is related to ``"Using bools for storage incurs overhead"`` and ``"State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots"`` from the bot report list. However, this specific focus is on using bitwise operations for ``bool`` flags, therefore it is unique.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function isDiamondStorageFrozen() external view returns (bool) {
    return ds.isFrozen == 1;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 5-10 gas per operation due to using bitwise ``EQ`` which is generally cheaper than ``SLOAD``.

### Possible Optimizations in [IMailbox.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [enum TxStatus](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol#L11C1-L14C2) currently defaults to ``uint8`` but explicitly setting it can make the contract more readable and ensure it uses the smallest possible integer type.

After Optimization:




```solidity
enum TxStatus: uint8 {
    Failure,
    Success
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Saves minimal gas but improves readability.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Use Function Overloading for [proveL2MessageInclusion()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol#L89C1-L94C36) and [proveL2LogInclusion()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IMailbox.sol#L96C1-L101C36)

After Optimization:




```solidity
// Optimization: Use function overloading to handle both L2Message and L2Log
// Note: This assumes that L2Message and L2Log are struct types that cannot be easily confused.
function proveInclusion(
    uint256 _l2BatchNumber,
    uint256 _index,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof,
    L2Message calldata _message
) external view returns (bool) {
    // Implementation remains the same as proveL2MessageInclusion
}

function proveInclusion(
    uint256 _l2BatchNumber,
    uint256 _index,
    bytes32[] calldata _proof,
    L2Log calldata _log
) external view returns (bool) {
    // Implementation remains the same as proveL2LogInclusion
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 100-200 gas per call.

### Possible Optimizations in [TransactionValidator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/TransactionValidator.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- In [getOverheadForTransaction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/TransactionValidator.sol#L133C14-L133C39) the [Math.max](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/TransactionValidator.sol#L141C9-L146C95) function calls involves a conditional check and can be replaced with a ternary operator for minimal functions.

After Optimization:




```solidity
// Before
batchOverheadForTransaction = Math.max(batchOverheadForTransaction, txSlotOverhead);

// After
batchOverheadForTransaction = (batchOverheadForTransaction > txSlotOverhead) ? batchOverheadForTransaction : txSlotOverhead;
```




- Estimated gas saved = Around 5-10 gas per operation.

### Possible Optimizations in [ValidatorTimelock.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/ValidatorTimelock.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- For the [commitBatches()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/ValidatorTimelock.sol#L77C1-L91C6) function, use bitwise operations to store and retrieve ``uint32`` timestamps within a ``uint256`` variable, allowing you to store 8 timestamps in a single ``uint256`` storage slot.
- Extra Context: Using bitwise operations to store and retrieve ``uint32`` timestamps within a ``uint256`` variable is a unique form of data packing. In relation to the bot report, which mentions ``"State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots"`` or ``"Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots by truncating timestamp bytes,"`` this specific optimization goes a step further by utilizing bitwise operations to pack multiple ``uint32`` timestamps into a single ``uint256`` storage slot, therefore I believe this is unique and not covered by the bot report.

After Optimization:




```solidity
uint256 packedTimestamps;

function commitBatches(
    StoredBatchInfo calldata,
    CommitBatchInfo[] calldata _newBatchesData
) external onlyValidator {
    uint32 timestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _newBatchesData.length; ++i) {
        uint256 position = i * 32;
        packedTimestamps |= (timestamp << position);
    }
    _propagateToZkSync();
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~20,000 gas per additional timestamp.

### Possible Optimization in [Admin.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Admin.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- For the [setPriorityTxMaxGasLimit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Admin.sol#L83C1-L89C6) fucntion you can use short-circuiting to avoid unnecessary calculations in the ``require`` statement.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function setPriorityTxMaxGasLimit(uint256 _newPriorityTxMaxGasLimit) external onlyGovernor {
    require(_newPriorityTxMaxGasLimit != 0 && _newPriorityTxMaxGasLimit <= L2_TX_MAX_GAS_LIMIT, "n5");

    uint256 oldPriorityTxMaxGasLimit = s.priorityTxMaxGasLimit;
    s.priorityTxMaxGasLimit = _newPriorityTxMaxGasLimit;
    emit NewPriorityTxMaxGasLimit(oldPriorityTxMaxGasLimit, _newPriorityTxMaxGasLimit);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Logical ``AND`` costs 3 gas, but if short-circuited, the second condition won't be evaluated, saving its gas cost.

### **Section 1 End: ZkSync**

### **Section 2: Bridges**: 

### Possible Optimizations in [L1ERC20Bridge.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 =
- The contract uses ``uint256`` for [totalDepositedAmountPerUser](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L61), which might be overkill. The [totalDepositedAmountPerUser](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L61) can fit into ``uint128``, to save storage costs.

- Extra Context: The bot report mentions that using uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead, which generally discourages the use of smaller data types. However, my optimization suggests that using ``uint128`` instead of ``uint256`` can actually save gas in storage operations when the range of the value is known to fit within ``uint128``. This is a more nuanced point that the list doesn't cover therefore I feel this optimization is unique in relation to the bot report. This is also completely safe to do, given that 2^128 is a very large number (3.4 × 10^38), even with flash loans, reaching this limit would require an impractically large amount of tokens or Ether. Therefore, the risk of overflow in this specific context is extremely low. 

Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint128)) public totalDepositedAmountPerUser;
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~20,000 - 30,000 gas per storage operation (SSTORE and SLOAD operations would be optimized)

Possible Optimization 2 =
- The contract uses bool for [isWithdrawalFinalized](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L39). This can be packed into a single ``uint256`` to save storage space.

- Extra Context: The bot report does mention that using bools for storage incurs overhead, it doesn't go into the specific technique of bit packing to optimize storage. Bit packing allows you to store multiple bool variables in a single uint256, thus saving storage space and gas. This is a specific optimization strategy not covered in the list.


Here is the optimized code snippet:




```solidity
uint256 flags; // isWithdrawalFinalized is bit 0

// Setter and Getter for isWithdrawalFinalized
function setIsWithdrawalFinalized(bool _value) internal {
    flags = _value ? (flags | 1) : (flags & ~1);
}

function getIsWithdrawalFinalized() internal view returns (bool) {
    return (flags & 1) == 1;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~20,000 - 30,000 gas per storage operation (SSTORE and SLOAD operations would be optimized)

Possible Optimization 3 =
- Batch Boolean Operations in [finalizeWithdrawal()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L293C2-L320C6), currently the function uses separate ``require`` statements for different conditions. These can be better combined to save gas on the ``JUMPI`` opcode.

- Extra Context: The list doesn't specifically mention the optimization of batching multiple conditions in a single require statement to save on the ``JUMPI`` opcode. While the list does talk about optimizing conditional statements, it doesn't go into this level of opcode-specific optimization.

Here is the optimized code snippet:





```solidity
function finalizeWithdrawal(
    // ... parameters
) external nonReentrant senderCanCallFunction(allowList) {
    require(
        !isWithdrawalFinalized[_l2BatchNumber][_l2MessageIndex] && 
        zkSync.proveL2MessageInclusion(_l2BatchNumber, _l2MessageIndex, l2ToL1Message, _merkleProof),
        "Invalid operation"
    );
    // ... rest of the code
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~30-60 gas per operation (due to reduced JUMPI opcode usage)

### Possible Optimization in [L1WethBridge.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1WethBridge.sol)
Possible Optimization =
- Similar to the previous optimization, you can use ``uint128`` for [_amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1WethBridge.sol#L162) in [deposit()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1WethBridge.sol#L159C1-L196C6) function as it is very unlikely the amount will ever exceed ``uint128``.
- Extra Context: Just like previous extra context, I feel this is a more nuanced point that the list doesn't cover therefore I am confident this optimization is unique in relation to the bot report. This is also completely safe to do, given that 2^128 is a very large number (3.4 × 10^38), even with flash loans, reaching this limit would require an impractically large amount of tokens or Ether. Therefore, the risk of overflow in this specific context is extremely low. 


Here is the optimized code:




```solidity
function deposit(
    // ... other parameters
    uint128 _amount,  // Changed from uint256 to uint128
    // ... other parameters
) external payable nonReentrant senderCanCallFunction(allowList) returns (bytes32 txHash) {
    // ... rest of the code
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~20,000 - 30,000 gas per storage operation as ``SSTORE`` and ``SLOAD`` operations would be optimized. 

### **Section 2 End: Bridges**

### **Section 3: Governance**:

### Possible Optimizations in [Governance.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/governance/Governance.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Instead of using multiple ``if-else`` conditions in [getOperationState()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/governance/Governance.sol#L105C2-L116C6), use a function table to map states to functions. This can make the code more modular and potentially save gas by reducing branching.




```solidity
function stateUnset(bytes32 _id) internal view returns (OperationState) { /* logic here */ }
function stateWaiting(bytes32 _id) internal view returns (OperationState) { /* logic here */ }
// ... other state functions

function[] internal stateFunctions = [stateUnset, stateWaiting /*, ... other states */];

function getOperationState(bytes32 _id) public view returns (OperationState) {
    return stateFunctions[timestamps[_id]](_id);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~1,000 - 3,000 gas per function call, due to reducing the number of ``JUMPI`` opcodes by reducing branching.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- If the ``Governance`` contract plans to introduce multiple ``bool`` flags for state management in the future (e.g., IsInitialized, IsPaused, etc.), using individual ``bool`` variables for each flag will consume more storage slots. If this is the case you can use a ``uint256`` variable named ``flags`` to act as a bitmap. Each bit in this 256-bit integer will represent a ``bool`` flag. Utilize bitwise operations to set, clear, or query these flags. By doing this method using a single ``uint256`` to store multiple ``flags``, you can save around 19,200 gas for each flag beyond the first one for initial storage and 4,200 gas for each ``flag`` beyond the first one for updates.

After Optimization: 




```solidity
    // New: Add a uint256 to act as a bitmap for multiple boolean flags
    uint256 internal flags;

    // New: Enum to represent the flags in a readable manner
    enum Flag { IsInitialized, IsPaused /*, ... other flags */ }

    // New: Function to set a flag in the bitmap
    function setFlag(Flag _flag, bool _value) internal {
        if (_value) {
            // New: Set the bit corresponding to the flag to 1
            flags |= (1 << uint256(_flag));
        } else {
            // New: Set the bit corresponding to the flag to 0
            flags &= ~(1 << uint256(_flag));
        }
    }

    // New: Function to get the value of a flag from the bitmap
    function getFlag(Flag _flag) internal view returns (bool) {
        // New: Check if the bit corresponding to the flag is set
        return (flags & (1 << uint256(_flag))) != 0;
    }
    
    // ... existing functions
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~5,000 - 10,000 gas per storage operation, as this will reduce the number of ``SSTORE`` and ``SLOAD`` operations by consolidating multiple ``bool`` values into a single storage slot.

### **Section 3 End: Governance**

### **Section 4: Upgrades**:

### Possible Optimizations in [BaseZkSyncUpgrade.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/upgrades/BaseZkSyncUpgrade.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- Consider using a single ``require`` statement in a common internal function. This can save gas by reducing the bytecode size.

After Optimization:




```solidity
// New internal function for common checks
function _commonChecks(uint256 timestamp, uint256 protocolVersion) internal {
    require(block.timestamp >= timestamp && protocolVersion > s.protocolVersion, "Common checks failed");
}

// Usage in upgrade function
function upgrade(ProposedUpgrade calldata _proposedUpgrade) public virtual returns (bytes32) {
    _commonChecks(_proposedUpgrade.upgradeTimestamp, _proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion);
    // ... rest of the code
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~200 - 400 gas per function call due to reduced bytecode size.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- Similar to previous optimizations, here instead of using multiple ``bool`` variables, use a single ``uint256`` as a bitmask to hold multiple ``bool`` values. This can save storage costs.

- Extra Context: This is similar to "Using bools for storage incurs overhead," but the focus I suggest is on using a bitmask for multiple ``bool`` values, which is not explicitly mentioned in your list, therefore unique in relation the bot report.

After Optimization: 




```solidity
uint256 internal flags;

// Define flags
uint256 constant HAS_BOOTLOADER = 1 << 0;
uint256 constant HAS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT = 1 << 1;

// Set flag
function _setFlags(bool hasBootloader, bool hasDefaultAccount) internal {
    flags = (hasBootloader ? HAS_BOOTLOADER : 0) | (hasDefaultAccount ? HAS_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT : 0);
}

// Check flag
function _hasBootloader() internal view returns (bool) {
    return flags & HAS_BOOTLOADER != 0;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = ~5,000 - 10,000 gas per storage operation. 

### **Section 4 End: Upgrades**
